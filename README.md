Project on Password Prediction based on enhanced PCFG (Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars) methods @ Fudan University

Analyzed more than 6 million passwords from some Chinese websites.
Implemented K-means clustering on English words and pattern recognition for Chinese pinyin to enhance the accuracy of prediction.
Showed better performance (40%) than the original PCFG algorithm.
